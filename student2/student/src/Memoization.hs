-- Pause:
-- We make the solution in two parts:

-- 2. We have a fast function that looks for the result in the cache
-- This wouldn't work in other languages, but because of lazy evaluation, it works, magic!

-- Using criterion, we can see that the fastFib function is a little slower than fasterFibo.
-- by using "stack bench --benchmark-arguments="--output bench.html"
-- And looking at the plots.

-- Now, for something cool
-- What if we make a function that creates the cache, and immediately looks in it?

-- It doesn't work... because the old fibo function calls itself
-- So even if we use memoize, the recursive calls don't use the cache...

-- To fix this, we need open recursion.
-- It looks tricky, but it's simple
-- 1. Look at the recursive function
-- 2. Replace the function calls to calls to another function
-- 3. And his 'other function' is a function f, passed as a parameter.

-- Here is Fibonacci in open recursion
-- This function can do other things than compute fibonacci, but
-- It isn't really recursive anymore
-- And it's easy to implement fibonacci again: (openFib fibo) does that.

-- CACHES FOR LISTS OF THINGS

-- If we want caches for lists, it's more complicated...

-- to its children, where each label has type 'edge'
-- 'node' and 'edge' can be any types.

You can inspect the cache with GHCI!

> let cache = trieCache ['a' .. 'z'] reverse
> :print cache

Prints the cache, and we can see nothing is evaluated
(Warning: Make sure function doesn't return a generic type, otherwise it doesn't work)

> trieLookup cache []
> :print cache

Prints the cache, and also the unevaluated thunks.
Print is very useful when you want to debug calculations with infinite structures
Cause it doesn't evaluate the whole thing.

And then, you can do

> trieLookup cache "hej"
> :print cache

Prints the cache, and you should be able to see it has grown
